# Tailwind CSS Container Utility Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `container` utility.  The issue involves unexpected behavior of the container on specific screen sizes, particularly when nested within other elements or when certain CSS rules are applied to parent containers.  The bug solution provides a fix for the issue.

## Bug Description
The `container` utility is intended to center content horizontally, but in some instances, it fails to center correctly or doesn't respect responsive breakpoints as expected. The primary issue is on screen sizes where the container does not scale down to the specified width and keeps to its default width. 

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` or the corresponding file in the repo.
3. Run the code and observe the container's behavior on various screen sizes.

## Solution
The solution addresses the unexpected behavior with a combination of CSS overrides, ensuring that the responsiveness of the container utility is consistent across different screen sizes and parent element contexts.
